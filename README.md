# Ebus-Management-Based-Current-Location-System
Ebus Management System Based on Current Location
Project Overview
The Ebus Management System is a web-based application that enables real-time tracking of buses based on their current GPS locations. It is designed to provide bus operators, commuters, and administrators with accurate and up-to-date information about the location and status of buses in a fleet. The system consists of a frontend for displaying the bus information and a backend for managing the data and providing APIs.

Key Features:

Real-time Bus Location Tracking: The system displays the current location of each bus using GPS coordinates.
Map Integration: The frontend integrates a mapping service (like Google Maps) to show the location of buses on a live map.
Bus Information Management: Administrators can add, update, or remove bus information, including the bus number, route, and schedule.
Mobile-friendly Interface: The frontend is responsive, allowing users to access the system on various devices like phones, tablets, and computers.
API Endpoints: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for fetching and updating bus data.

Architecture and Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)
Environment Variables Management: dotenv
API Integration: Google Maps API (optional)

Project Structure
The project follows a standard MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with a clean separation between the frontend and backend.

Frontend: Displays bus location, provides UI for interacting with the system.
Backend: Manages bus location data and serves it through RESTful APIs.
Database: MongoDB for persisting bus details and real-time location data.
